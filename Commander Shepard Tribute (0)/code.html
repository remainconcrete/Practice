          Shepard was born on April 11, 2154, is a graduate of the Systems Alliance N7 special forces program (service
          no. 5923-AC-2826), a veteran of the Skyllian Blitz, and is initially assigned to the SSV Normandy in 2183 as
          Executive Officer, with a Systems Alliance rank of Lieutenant Commander. Shepard later becomes the first human
          to join the Spectres, an elite special task force for the Citadel Council.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Commander Shepard is named after Alan Bartlett Shepard, Jr., the second person and the first American in
            space (May 5, 1961). He later commanded the Apollo 14 mission in 1971 and became the fifth person to walk on
            the Moon.</li>
          <li>Shepard's birthday (April 11) is the same day that Apollo 13 (an American attempted manned moon landing
            mission that almost ended in disaster) was launched (April 11, 1970).</li>
          <li>Shepard seems to speak with a hint of Canadian dialect. This may be because Mark Meer and Jennifer Hale,
            the voices of the male and female Shepard, respectively, are Canadian.</li>
          <li>The default names of both the male and female Shepard are the names for an unidentified male (John Doe)
            and female (Jane Doe) respectively.</li>
          <li>It would appear that Shepard has a gift for being a leader. Miranda Lawson draws attention to this,
            claiming that Shepard has "that fire that makes someone willing to follow you into hell itself". This is
            similar to the protagonist (Revan) of BioWare's Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic, who is also said to
            possess such a trait.</li>
          <li>To keep the exact nature of Shepard's return quiet in Mass Effect 2, it is often stated that the Commander
            almost died, which is not really truthful. The male Shepard would later joke with Jack that he is
            "technically undead".</li>
          <li>Commander Shepard appears in another Electronic Arts game, MySims SkyHeroes, as a pilot.</li>
          <li>Commander Shepard is briefly referenced in background chatter in the first episode of the Halo TV series:
            "Commander Shepherd, you are requested at the Skillian Response Center." 343 Industries' Kiki Wolfkill
            confirmed it as a deliberate Easter egg.</li>
        </ul>
