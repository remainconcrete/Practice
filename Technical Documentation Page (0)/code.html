            <p id="topic1p1">The ideas of the Fallout series began with Interplay Productions' Wasteland, released in
                1988. At that time, Interplay was not a publisher and used Electronic Arts for distribution of the game.
                According to Interplay's founder, Brian Fargo, they wanted to explore a post-apocalyptic setting and
                created Wasteland for that. Sometime after release, Interplay decided to shift focus and become a
                publisher while still developing games. Fargo wanted to continue to use the Wasteland intellectual
                property but could not negotiate the rights back from Electronic Arts.</p>
            <p id="topic1p2">Still wanting to do something in a post-apocalyptic setting, Fargo and his team decided to
                make a new setting and game. They determined what aspects of Wasteland were positives and wrote and
                developed a new game around them. The result was the first <code>Fallout</code> games, which released
                nearly ten years after Wasteland.</p>

            <p id="topic2p1">The series' first title, Fallout, was developed by Black Isle Studios and released in 1997,
                and its sequel, Fallout 2, the following year. With the tactical role-playing game Fallout Tactics:
                Brotherhood of Steel, development was handed to Micro Forté and 14 Degrees East. In 2004, Interplay
                closed Black Isle Studios, and continued to produce Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel, an action game with
                role-playing elements for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox, without Black Isle Studios. Fallout 3, the third
                entry in the main series, was released by Bethesda Softworks, and was followed by Fallout: New Vegas,
                developed by Obsidian Entertainment. Fallout 4 was released in 2015, and Fallout 76 released on November
                14, 2018.</p>

            <p id="topic3p1"><code>SPECIAL</code> is a character creation and statistics system developed specifically
                for the Fallout series. SPECIAL is an acronym, representing the seven attributes used to define Fallout
                characters: Strength, Perception, Endurance, Charisma, Intelligence, Agility and Luck. SPECIAL is
                heavily based on <code>GURPS</code>, which was originally intended to be the character system used in
                the game.</p>
            <p id="topic3p2">The SPECIAL system was used in Fallout, Fallout 2, and Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of
                Steel. A modified version of the system was used in Fallout: Warfare, Fallout 3, Fallout: New Vegas,
                Fallout 4 and Fallout Shelter.</p>

            <p id="topic4p1">The series is set in a fictionalized United States in an alternate history scenario that
                diverges from reality following World War II. In this alternative atompunk "golden age", vacuum tubes
                and atomic physics serve as the foundations of scientific progress, while transistors are not as
                scientifically important in this world. As such, a bizarre socio-technological status quo emerges, in
                which advanced robots, nuclear-powered cars, directed-energy weapons, and other futuristic technologies
                are seen alongside 1950s-era computers and televisions. The United States divides itself into 13
                commonwealths and the aesthetics and Cold War paranoia of the 1950s continue to dominate the American
                lifestyle well into the 21st century.</p>
            <p id="topic4p2">More than a hundred years before the start of the series, an energy crisis emerged caused
                by the depletion of petroleum reserves, leading to a period called the "Resource Wars" in April 2052 – a
                series of events which included a war between the European Commonwealth and the Middle Eastern states,
                the disbanding of the United Nations, the U.S. invasion of Mexico and annexation of Canada, and a
                Chinese invasion and subsequent military occupation of Alaska coupled with their release of the "New
                Plague" that devastated the American mainland. As global situations worsened, the American Government
                became increasingly jingoistic and authoritarian, going as far as having dissidents sent off to
                re-education camps and experimentation. Tensions between the United States and China eventually
                culminated in the <code>"Great War"</code> on the morning of October 23, 2077, eastern standard time, a
                two-hour nuclear exchange on an apocalyptic scale, which subsequently created the post-apocalyptic
                United States, the setting of the Fallout world.</p>

            <p id="topic5p1">The Fallout series has been met with mostly positive reception. The highest rated title is
                Fallout 3 and the lowest is Fallout 76 according to review aggregator <code>Metacritic</code>.</p>
            <p id="topic5p2">Not all fans are happy with the direction the Fallout series has taken since its
                acquisition by Bethesda Softworks. Notorious for their vehement support of the series' first two games,
                Fallout and Fallout 2, members centered around one of the oldest Fallout fansites, No Mutants Allowed,
                have cried foul over departures from the original games' stories, gameplay mechanics and setting. Minor
                criticisms include the prevalence of unspoiled food after 200 years, the survival of wood-framed
                dwellings after a nuclear blast, and the ubiquity of Super Mutants at early levels in the game. More
                serious criticisms involve the quality of the game's writing, lack of verisimilitude, the switch to a
                first-person action game format, and the reactiveness of the surrounding game world to player actions.
                In response, Jim Sterling of Destructoid has called fan groups like No Mutants Allowed "selfish" and
                "arrogant"; stating that a new audience deserves a chance to play a Fallout game; and that if the series
                had stayed the way it was back in 1997, new titles would never have been made and brought to market.
                Luke Winkie of Kotaku tempers these sentiments, saying that it is a matter of ownership; and that in the
                case of Fallout 3, hardcore fans of the original series witnessed their favorite games become
                transformed into something else and that they are "not wrong" for having grievances.
                The redesigned dialogue interface featured in Fallout 4 received mixed reception by the community.
                Unsatisfied fans created mods for the game, providing subtitles and allowing the player to know what
                their character would say before choosing it as it was in previous games in the franchise such as in
                Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas. Though even taking the mods into account, Patricia Hernandez of Kotaku
                still criticized the writing of the game in her review, describing it as "thin", "You never have
                particularly long or nuanced conversations with the other characters. I like to play a Charisma-focused
                character, and I was disappointed."
                Upon release, Fallout 76 became the lowest rated title in the series due to its mixed reception and
                criticisms from reviewers. It has been the subject of several controversies since its release.</p>
