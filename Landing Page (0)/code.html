                Life is Strange is a five-part episodic adventure game that sets out to revolutionize story-based choice
                and consequence games. It is developed by DONTNOD Entertainment and published by Square Enix. The
                developers describe the game as a nostalgic coming-of-age story that combines the present with the past,
                creating key moments for each episode. Episode 1, "Chrysalis", was released on January 29, 2015 and the
                final episode, "Polarized", was released on October 20, 2015. A Japanese version was released on March
                3, 2016. A macOS and Linux port by Feral Interactive was released on July 21, 2016. On December 12,
                2017, a version for mobile platforms was announced, fully released in March 29 and July 18, 2018.

                The game's protagonist is Maxine Caulfield, better known as Max, a shy 18-year-old photography senior
                who discovers she can rewind time to change the course of events. Back in her hometown Arcadia Bay, a
                picturesque seaside town in Oregon, Max is reunited with her old friend, Chloe Price, and they start to
                uncover the truth behind fellow student Rachel Amber's mysterious disappearance, and soon they find
                themselves exposed to the darker side of Arcadia Bay.

                Max gets disturbing premonitions of the future, and must take on the responsibility to prevent a
                devastating destiny for her town. As she struggles to understand the implications of her power, she must
                quickly learn which consequences her interfering in time and space holds.

                The characters have to deal with everyday life issues created by their own families and school mates,
                and as you can expect in a typical public high school environment, there is a lot of high school drama,
                and sometimes teens make bad decisions. Players will be given the opportunity to make choices while
                playing Max, and each choice will have consequences in gameplay. Her ability to 'rewind time' will
                impact the game's narrative. There are multiple endings depending on the choices the player makes for
                Max. The game has a licensed indie soundtrack and hand-painted visuals.

                The game approaches real world issues and problematic situations such as depression, bullying, suicide,
                domestic violence, mental illness and the loss of loved ones. </p>

                During its release, Life is Strange received generally favorable reviews commending its unique art
                style, the character development, the rewind game mechanic and its smart take on branching storytelling
                as well as the use of taboo subjects. It was also praised both among reviewers and fans for featuring
                female protagonists and for the portrayal of gay romance. Some reviewers disliked the slang, lack of
                lip-syncing and tonal inconsistencies.

                The first episode was ranked fifth among the best selling PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4 video games of
                February 2015. It had sold one million digital copies by the end of July 2015. As of May 2017, more than
                three million copies have been sold.

                The complete season received a Metascore of 83/85 and a User Score of 8.6/8.7. On Opencritic, it
                currently has a rating of 81. It is rated as "overwhelmingly positive" (with 96% of over 120,000 user
                reviews) on Steam. </p>
